    <p>
      This specification defines a set of classes and properties that
      structure information about human remains. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="status">Status of this Document</h2>
    <p>
      This document is a standard that was developed after some
      conversations at the
      <a href="http://lod-lam.net/">LODLAM</a> meeting in San Francisco and
      the email exchanges that followed. While minor modifications will be
      made over time, this ontology should be now considered mature.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>This project was created as a result of some of the data and modeling
    problems encountered in the <a href="http://www.muninn-project.org/">Muninn WW1 Project</a> with respects to the
    treatment of the remains of soldiers on the battlefield. The Great War
    was one of the first conflicts where an attempt was made to locate the final resting places
    of soldiers killed on the battlefield. The scope of the conflict was
    such that the registration and management of graves and cemeteries
    required (in the experience of the British Empire) the creation of a commission whose work is still ongoing in
    2022.</p>
    
    <p>The modeling of the processes of death, burial, re-interment as well of
    the erection of various monuments, markers and cenotaph became too
    complex for simple event-style data structures. Furthermore, a portable ontology
    unrelated to the original project goals became desirable to develop simple linkages
    to other projects.</p>

    <h2 id="newinversion">2. New in this version</h2>

    <p>Version 1.5 brings some much needed spring cleaning to this ontology.  The ontology and dataset header are now fully
    populated with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/">void</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/">dcat<a/>, <a href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/vocommons/voaf/v2.3/#Vocabulary">voaf</a> and <a href="https://schema.org/docs/data-and-datasets.html">schema:Dataset</a> definitions.  This version also includes examples shown in multiple
    serializations, the deprecation of the <a href="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/organization#">Muninn Organization</a>
     ontology and the <a href="http://iptc.org/std/rNews/2011-10-07#">rnews ontology</a> in favor of ontologies such as
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">Time</a>
    and <a href="#geosparql">GeoSparql</a> and the <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> vocabularies, all of 
    which have strong ongoing development activities.</p>
    <p>Version 1.5 also marks a shift towards https URIs for term
    identification in order to benefit from secure protocols while http
    class remains accessible through owl:sameAs statements. Furthermore all
    owl classes are also provided as rdfs classes to promote
    interoperability to non-owl applications. The ontology is also available
    through json-ld, owl, nt and turtle serialization format.</p>
    
    <p>This is also the first version to be archived on zenodo, assigned oid ONTOLOGY_OID and can be cited in the following
    fashion:</p>

    <h2 id="objectives">3. Ontology objectives and limitations</h2>

    <p>The initial design objectives for the ontology were:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>The ability to markup simple grave information without excessive overhead.</li>
     <li>Provide a framework to reference graves, cemeteries and remains within other data-sets.</li>
     <li>Enable a data provider to explicitly mark grave location
     information as being obfuscated for privacy reasons, as in the case of
     an active archaeological dig on private property.</li>
     <li>Provide an ontological structure that has the necessary hooks for
     future reasoning.</li>
     <li>Identity can be referenced both through the monument commemoration or through the remains in the grave. This provides a
     convenient means of dealing with misidentified corpses.</li>
     <li>Enable the use of tombstones and memorials as a data integration point for individuals referenced in different data
     sets.</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>A number of issues and corner cases aren't currently addressed.</p>
     <ol>
     <li>The orientation of the remains within a grave is not currently recorded.</li>

     <li>Remains can be marked as being partial, where less than the
     complete skeleton is present within the grave. This deals neatly with
     mass graves but does not document what was actually found in the
     grave. A complete forensic description is beyond the scope of this
     ontology.</li> 
     </ol>
     
     <h2 id="location">3. Ontology objectives and limitations</h2>
     
     <p>Grave location represents a difficulty is that there is no unified standard for archaeological digs
     and cemetery plots. Furthermore, positional and geometry accuracy can be lacking due to inaccurate historical records.</p>
     
     
     Assigning basic longitude and latitude is possible through the hasLocation sub properties 
     but it may be desirable to record the native grid coordinates through the use of an hasLocation property 
     with a string. An additional property hasMap exists to provide a reference to an image of the cemetery map
     or computer readable coordinate system class.</li>

     <p>Labeling and naming policies. In many cases 
     A term may have one and only one rdfs:label literal per xml:lang tag. The reason for this is that when using the ontology
     within a sparql query and attempting to retrieve labels 

    <!--  cenotaph, digsite, plaque, Tombstone, marker, mass_grave, ashes -->

    <h2 id="sec-glance">4. Basic ontological constructs</h2>

    <p>The philosophy of the graves ontology is to provide a basic set of
      classes that represent most of the information necessary to identify a
      grave of interest and describe its physical location.</p>
    <p>
      Graves makes use of the OWL ontological markup and has
      four basic groups of objects: cemeteries and/or archaeological digs,
      graves, remains (skeletons or ashes) and monuments.</p>
      
    <p>Cemeteries and archaeological digs are the primary location where
      graves and remains are to be found and the administrative unit that maintains
      them. Depending on the end application, these classes may be
      considered subclasses of geographical features, organizations or
      projects.
      </p>
    <p>A grave is defined as a <a
      href="#Container_for_human_remains">receptacle</a> <a
      href="#Remains">for human
      remains</a>. Subclasses are
      used for cases of <a hreg="#Empty_grave">Empty Graves</a> or <a
      hreg="#Mass_grave">Mass Graves</a>. 
    </p>
    <p><a href="#Remains">Human remains</a> are classes which deal with
    <a href="#Skeleton">full skeletons</a>, the <a href="#Partial_remains">partial remains</a> of a human being (especially in the
    case of some arch digs) and their <a href="#Ashes">ashes</a> after
    creation.</p>
    <p>Lastly, most graves or death are commemorated in some way through the
    use of a <a href="#Tombstone">Tombstone</a> or some sort of <a href="#Monument">Monument</a>. In all cases, the ontology
    supports the description of the <a href="#moved_to">movement</a> 
    or rearrangement over time.</p>
    
   <h3 id="nomenclature">Notes on nomenclature</h3>      

   <p>Nomenclature within the ontology has three aspects: labels, names and TemporalNames.</p>
   
   <p>Every term within the ontology has both an rdfs:label term, intended to provide a string for end application programmers to
   present to the user, and an foaf:name term intended to represent proper names. When no proper name exists, both properties
   have the same value. In order to keep SPARQL queries from creating redundant results, the ontology contains no more than one
   property instance per language tag.</p>
   
   <p>The reason for this approach is due to the coexistence between rdfs, skos and foaf: rdfs:label properties are considered by some to
   be programmer facing information, foaf:name used only for entities and skos introduces additional possibilities for logical
   inconsistencies. For terms that have multiple nomenclatures for individual entities, multiple instances of the skos:altLabel
   property are used. However, these are meant to facilitate search and should not be used for display purposes.</p>  
   
   <p>Every node within the ontology provides a rdfs:label human readable label in English, French and German.  Because case can
   be important in labeling in some languages, this ontology permits mixed-case in all labels.  ISO704 compliant labels can be
   created by forcing the label to lowercase.</p>
   
   <p>The additional term graves:TemporalNames is provided by the ontology to assign names to entities within a time range.</p>

     <h2 id="#overview">5. Ontology use cases</h2>      
     <p>Use cases specific to Graves:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Identify individuals not referenced in the official rolls through their commemoration on monuments.</li> 
      <li>Provide hooks for the linkages of identity of individuals by referencing a specific artifact on which their name appears.</li>
      <li>Provide point of interest data in a format that permits faceted retrieval.</li>
      <li>When identity, location or any another item is unknown or ambiguous provide the hooks that allow for machine resolution
      of the ambiguity.</li>
     </ol>     
     
   <h2 id="all_examples">6. Examples</h2>

            
    <h3 id="simple_example">6.1. The grave of the Unknown Soldier, A Running Example</h3>
   
    <p>We start with a grave, with someone's remains in it. The urls are shortened to look pleasing.</p>   
        the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a> ontology to point to a picture of the grave.</p>
 
    
     importRDFExample[An example of a grave][doc/ex-basic-grave.owl]
     

<p>Next, we add the tombstone that was erected over the grave and record it inscription. We have a picture of the tombstone so we
add a depiction of it.</p>    

     importRDFExample[An example of a grave with a tombstone][doc/ex-basic-grave-tombstone.owl]

<p>Thus the grave contains a skeleton of an unknown Canadian soldier and has a tombstone marking it. Because we do not know the
identity of the fallen soldier, it is not possible to put a name to the remains. However we can pro-actively create an instance of
the person and add what we do know about this soldier to that reference. This would look like:</p>

     importRDFExample[An example of a grave of an Unknown Soldier][doc/ex-basic-grave-tombstone-unknown.owl]


<p>We could have taken this example a little further and added that 1) the soldier should have been born at a minimum before 1902
(you would need to be 16 to look old enough to enlist) and 2) male (this *is* the first world war). Why is this important?
Later on, this will allows anyone to reconcile their list of lost soldiers with our lost soldier because we are providing a
unique identifier for that person (which someone else can reference) and providing other with what we know about them (e.g.: A
German Red Cross Nurse missing in action from that period would obviously not be a match).</p>  
    
<p>Lastly, the grave is contained within the Givenchy Road Canadian Cemetery in France in location C6. The final markup for this
example is thus:</p>

      importRDFExample[An example of a grave at Givenchy Cemetery][doc/ex-basic-grave-givenchy-C6.owl]

   <p>The complete RDF dump of this example can be queried <a HREF="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/dump.php?query=http://rdf.muninn-project.org/modern/2011/11/11/MilitaryCemetery/82b2db43b076dd098e1f6bcca561ddbd&output=rdfxml">here</a>.
    
    <p>We can extend the rdf with some owl statements to encode more knowledge
    within the markup. Taking the previous example, we can restrict the
    potential identity of the remains within the grave to the set of soldiers that are known to be missing in action.
    The markup gets rather ugly in OWL for large collections of
    missing soldiers, but this is why we have a machine do it.</p>

    importRDFExample[An example of assigning an uncertain identity][doc/ex-basic-grave-givenchy-identity.owl] 

 <H3 id="example_forest">6.2. A lone grave in the forest, A Simple Example</h3>    
    <p>The simple grave on the banks of the river in northern Ontario,
    without cemetery or graveyard. The name of the
    person is partially known as well as the date of death, but we don't
    create a Person instance for him.</p>

    importRDFExample[A grave in Algonquin Park][doc/ex-algonquin.owl]
    
   <p>The complete RDF dump of this example can be queried <a HREF="http://rdf.muninn-project.org/dump.php?query=http://rdf.muninn-project.org/modern/2011/11/11/Grave/b5c8905bbb8a06fdad46c9d115d738af&output=rdfxml">here</a>.
    
    <h3 id="cibcwaterloobranch_example">6.3. CIBC Waterloo Branch Plaque, Medium Example</h3>

    <p>After the Great War, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Bank_of_Commerce">Canadian Bank of Commerce</a>
    commissioned a book and a series of plaques to commemorate its employees
    that participated in the Great War. In 1961, the bank merged with the
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Bank_of_Canada">Imperial Bank of
    Canada</a> to form modern day <a href="http://www.cibc.ca/">Canadian Imperial Bank of
    Commerce</a>.</p>
    <p>This particular plaque is now displayed at the Uptown Waterloo, Ontario
    CIBC branch. Interestingly, one of the soldiers listed <a

    does not appear in any of the Great War databases but is referenced in
    the Canadian Bank of Commerce "Letters from The Front", Volume 2, Page
    194.</p>   
    <p>In the following markup, the <a hef="http://dev.iptc.org/rNews">rnews</a> markup is used to records a North
    American style street and mailing address as well as a <a

	<h4 id="cibcwaterloobranch_example_image">CIBC Waterloo Branch Plaque
	- Image Markup</h4> 
<img border=2 src="cibc-ONTOLOGY_DATE.png" alt="CIBC Waterloo Branch Plaque" id="cibcplaque" usemap="#GraffleExport2" style="float: right; padding:10px;" >
	<p>There has been some discussion about the representation and
	markup of a monument surface to link certain elements to annotations
	and further RDF. The Graves ontology only deals with the monument in
	itself and the image of the monument is linked through a depiction
	property. Since most people mean to annotate an image for human
	consumption, the simplest way to do this it through html image maps
	and svg	annotation. There have been attempts at that in the past,
	notably in the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/mmsem/XGR-image-annotation-20070814/#exampleApollo7">W3C
	Incubator Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.mindswap.org/2003/PhotoStuff/">Mindswap Image Annotator</a>
	using the <a
	href="http://www.mindswap.org/2005/owl/digital-media">Image Region
	Ontology</a>.</p>
	<p>All of these tools rely so far on embedding svg markup into rdf.
	This is useful for directly producing an image in the style of the Figure
	below in that the svg can be superimposed over the image or
	converted into an html map. However, it is not possible to access
	the data from within the linked open data world.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://linkedgeodata.org">Linked Geo Data</a> makes
	use of an approach based on rdf:Seq and rdf:li (see this <a
	ref="http://linkedgeodata.org/geometry/posSeq119212346">example</a> for
	the Soviet Cemetery in Weimar). This works in an rdf setting but not
	necessarily in an owl setting and needs further thinking.</p>
	<p>Graves deals primarily with discrete aspects of monument
	annotation, such as (artistic) title, (place) name and inscription
	and epitaph. The simplest way to integrate an external annotation to the
	graves ontology is to repeatedly use the inscription property to
	link specific annotation instances to both the image instance of the monument
	and the Graves instance of the monument.</p>
	
   <H3 id="example_weimar">6.4. Soviet Cemetery in Weimar, A Complete Cemetery Example</H3>
   
   <p>The Soviet Military Cemetery is Weimar, Germany dates from the end of the Second World War. 3 men to hole in the ground, 6
   men to a tombstone, the cemetery is an odd place frozen in time following the end of the Second World War and the beginning of
   the cold war.  The grass is still cut, but the gas torch that used to blaze on the soviet monument has long been turned off. 
   Some tombstones have a full inscription, some only a surname.</p>
   <p>The cemetery contains several hundreds of graves and the rdf is fully materialized with inverse properties. Notice that the
   graves:hasFrontFace and graves:hasFrontFace properties were used to identify which side of the tombstone the inscriptions are 
   inscribed on.</p>

<p>The Kitchener Cenotaph was built in 1929 and was moved twice before coming to its current location. During that time, the
inscriptions were changed to reflect the events of the Second World War and the Korean War. The image below is an image map that

 <h3 id="boerwar_example">6.7. Halifax Boer War Memorial, A Very Complex Example</h3>

     <p>In certain cases it is desirable to breakdown a large and complex
     monument into smaller sub-monuments for both simplicity, ease of
     retrieval and to express specific cultural artifacts.</p>
     
     <p>This example marks up the Halifax Boer War Memorial in Halifax,
     Nova Scotia and is represented using a series of sub monuments each
     having several faces to them. The html image map below is linked to the
     rdf instances within Muninn.</p>
